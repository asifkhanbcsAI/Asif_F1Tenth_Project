# F1Tenth_Evaluation
This is a ROS2 package that contains the evaluation scripts needed for the F1Tenth 

## Notes
- **For evaluating your algorithms, please remember to replace `wall_follower` in the launch file with the required algorithm.**
- **The evaluation script will only run for 10 minutes and will print the final results and kill the node.**
- **Make sure the f1tenth simulator is running before launching the nodes**
- **To visualise the lap_marker, in RViz click "Add" > click on the "By topic" tab > click on the topic "`/lap_marker`" > click "Ok"**
